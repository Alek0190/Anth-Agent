# Anth-Agent

> **Anthward's durable agent team.** Agents build client products, ship them, watch them live and fix them, on your laptop, your cloud and throwaway sandboxes, and they stop for your approval before anything risky.

Anth-Agent is a fork of [disler/durable-pi](https://github.com/disler/durable-pi) (MIT), built on [pi-durable](https://earendil.com/posts/pi-durable/) from the team behind the [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Every device runs `anth-backend`, which owns its agents, their SQLite databases and their tools. Clients connect with a **URL and a bearer token**: the web hub, `anth-tui` in the terminal, or one `curl`. **The agent lives on the device, not in the client.** Close the browser, quit the terminal or restart the machine mid-tool, and the run picks up from its last checkpoint.

**Plan:** [`docs/ANTH-AGENT-PLAN.md`](docs/ANTH-AGENT-PLAN.md) has the architecture and the seven-phase roadmap. Done so far: Phase 1 (fork and rename) Phase 2 (Clients → Projects → Environments: each device stores clients and projects, sessions carry a project and an environment, and the hub tree merges them across devices) Phase 3 (the agent team: a Lead that delegates to API, backend, frontend, tester, reviewer, security and ops members, each a durable child conversation with its own model and tools) and Phase 4 (the `ship` job: branch, build and test, review, Vercel preview, pull request, your approval, then that exact preview promoted to production; plus `rollback`) Phase 5 (watch and fix: Vercel logs or the app server's own logs, uptime checks and a webhook per project, Jev triage, an incident agent in its own worktree whose fix must fail on the base branch and pass on its branch before ship starts and waits for you) and Phase 6 (your own servers: ship to a Hetzner app server with Docker and Caddy over a key that can only run `anth-deploy`, zero-downtime promote and rollback, and an always-on agent box: see [`docs/HETZNER.md`](docs/HETZNER.md)), and the start of Phase 7: Telegram alerts with Approve / Reject buttons and a real Telegram call when something urgent needs you ([`docs/TELEGRAM.md`](docs/TELEGRAM.md)).

## Install

### Agentic Install

Open the repository in Claude Code (or Pi, or your favorite agentic coding tool) and run:

```text
/install
```

The command lives in [`.claude/commands/install.md`](.claude/commands/install.md). It checks Node 24, npm, just and zsh, confirms `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env` without printing it, runs `just install`, writes this machine's device config with `just net up local`, builds the web UI, offers to set up the proactive demo and finishes with `just check`. It never starts a server and never touches a device other than `local`. Run `/prime` afterwards to load the project context into your agent.

### Manual Install

**Prereqs:** [Node.js 24](https://nodejs.org) (via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)), [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), `zsh` (macOS ships it), an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key. Remote devices need passwordless `ssh`, and exe.dev VMs need an [exe.dev](https://exe.dev) account.

```bash
cp .env.example .env                           # set OPENROUTER_API_KEY; copied into each device's backend.env, never sent to clients
cp anth-network.example.yaml anth-network.yaml   # your devices; starts with only `local`
just install                                   # npm install for anth-sdk, anth-backend, anth-hub and anth-tui
just net up local                              # write ~/.anth/backend.env with a fresh token and register this machine
just hub build                                 # build the web UI the hub serves (once, and after UI changes)
just backend run                               # this machine's device server on :4780
just hub start                                 # web UI on http://localhost:4781 (second terminal)
just tui attach local                          # or attach from the terminal (third terminal)
```

The proactive demo has its own dependencies: `just proactive install`, `just proactive build`, then `just proactive take`.

## What is a durable agent?

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/02_pi_made_durable.svg" alt="Pi persists history only and loses its run state on exit; Durable Pi commits history, queues, app state and task checkpoints to SQLite" width="780">
</p>

Can't you just `/resume`? Resume restores a chat transcript. It does not know which tool call was running when the process died, what that call already changed, what input was queued behind it, or what your application believed was true. A durable agent commits all of it (history, queued input, task checkpoints and application state) to storage **before** anything is shown. Reopen the storage and the harness knows exactly where every piece of work stopped.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/03_restart_mid_tool.svg" alt="A device restarts during a bash call; the call comes back as interrupted and the agent resumes from its checkpoint and runs the next tool" width="780">
</p>

Replay-safe tools rerun after a crash. A tool that may have partially run, like a `bash` call cut off by a restart, comes back as an interrupted result, so the agent decides what happens next instead of silently repeating a side effect. Once a run survives its own process, it no longer needs the window that started it. So the agent moves to the device, and every interface becomes a thin client of one HTTP API. **The device owns the run. Clients only watch and steer.**

---

## The hook: a proactive durable agent

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/04_fix_ready_before_you_arrive.svg" alt="Timeline: a bad deploy at T+5 s, the incident agent detects, investigates, finds the root cause, fixes and is ready for review by T+25 s, then waits for your deploy approval at T+30 s" width="800">
</p>

A durable agent doesn't have to wait for your prompt. [`apps/proactive-demo`](apps/proactive-demo) watches a mock production log stream: Google Cloud Run entries for an online store. When guest checkouts start failing, code opens an incident and starts a durable agent on its own. By the time you show up, the agent has sized the impact from the logs, found the commit that broke checkout, written the fix and a regression test, and proved the test fails on `main` and passes on its branch. **Then it waits for you to approve the deploy.** It doesn't wait for you to work. It works for you, then waits.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/05_judge_every_row.svg" alt="Jev labels every log row normal, suspicious or incident; code counts three incident verdicts with one fingerprint within 120 seconds; the incident agent works every stage and waits for approval" width="800">
</p>

[Jev](https://typesafe.ai) judges every log row, and each layer does the one job it is best at:

| Layer | Decides | In the demo |
|---|---|---|
| **Code** | thresholds and side effects | 3 incident verdicts with one fingerprint within 120 s open an incident |
| **Jev** | bounded judgments, one call per row | `normal`, `suspicious` or `incident` plus an impact score, in a few hundred milliseconds for about $0.00003 a row |
| **Agent** | open-ended work | investigate, fix, prove, deploy: about $0.09 per incident with Sonnet 5.5 |

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/06_proactive_ui.png" alt="The proactive demo: the incident agent is ready for review and its deploy waits for approval, next to the Jev-judged event stream with incident rows highlighted" width="800">
</p>

You stay near the loop. The deploy is a durable task owned by the agent's tool call:

- **Decline or interrupt it**, and nothing ships.
- **Question it.** Ask the agent about the change before you decide.
- **Approve it.** A new checkout-api revision built from the agent's commit rolls out and is verified on live checkouts.
- **Restart through it.** Kill the backend while the deploy waits. After the restart, the same task is still waiting and nothing runs twice.

```bash
just proactive take   # fresh take: prints the URL; the bug deploys at 5 s and the agent asks to deploy at about 30 s
just proactive bug    # deploy the bad commit now instead
just proactive stop   # end the demo
```

The playbook, tools, hooks, Jev questions, thresholds and model are all yours to change. The timeline, flags and recovery checks are in [`apps/proactive-demo/README.md`](apps/proactive-demo/README.md).

## The Durable Agent Network

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/07_one_api_every_client.svg" alt="The web UI, anth-tui and curl all call /v1 with a bearer token on anth-backend, which runs the agent and commits it to agent.sqlite" width="780">
</p>

| Piece | Where it runs | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **`anth-backend`** | every device, port 4780; a launchd or systemd service on remote machines | the harnesses, `~/.anth/backend/catalog.sqlite`, one `sessions/<id>/agent.sqlite` per session, the device's shared App State, the bearer token in `~/.anth/backend.env` |
| **hub** (`apps/anth-hub`) | your laptop, `127.0.0.1:4781` | the device registry and tokens in `~/.anth/network.sqlite`, a token-injecting REST proxy, one multiplexed SSE stream per browser tab, the Vue client |
| **`anth-tui`** | any terminal | nothing: it reads a device's URL and token from the registry and talks to the device directly |
| **`anth-sdk`** | inside all of the above | the v1 wire contract, `AnthClient`, the SSE reader, the `AgentModel` and `SessionModel` reducers, transcript items, the registry and the ops drivers. See [`apps/anth-sdk/README.md`](apps/anth-sdk/README.md) |

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/08_device_session_agent.svg" alt="A device holds sessions, each session is one harness and one agent.sqlite, and each session holds agents: Main, forks and subagents; the address mac-mini:api-refactor:fork names all three" width="780">
</p>

The network has three levels. A **device** runs one `anth-backend`. A **session** is one pi-durable harness and one database in a working directory on that device. An **agent** is a conversation in that session: `Main`, a fork or a subagent. The [v1 API](apps/anth-backend/API.md) lives at the device's URL and addresses sessions and agents by id or name (`/v1/sessions/release-notes/agents/main`). It streams the device, a session or an agent as `hello → snapshot → deltas`, and makes every send idempotent through a `requestId`. Streams never replay: a reconnect starts from a fresh snapshot, which is why a killed client loses nothing. The web client and the TUI feed the same frames into the same `AgentModel` and render the same transcript items. **One reducer, two renderers.**

---

## What a durable agent can do

Every capability below is in the web client's inspector and in the [v1 API](apps/anth-backend/API.md), and the agent can use most of them as tools. Every change applies from the agent's next request, and nothing restarts.

### Compaction in the background

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/09_compact_keep_history.svg" alt="Ten stored history entries stay intact while the model context becomes a summary of entries 1 to 7 plus the recent entries 8 to 10" width="780">
</p>

The context bar marks where automatic compaction starts and where it blocks: a background summary at 200k tokens and a blocking one at 250k by default (smaller model windows fall back to pi-durable's margins), adjustable per session. The summary is written in the background while the agent keeps working. The stored history keeps every entry, and the agent's `search_history` tool pages through all of it, including what came before a compaction or a reset.

### One shared App State

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/10_shared_app_state.svg" alt="Main and a subagent change one path each and the revision climbs to 5, a fork reads the document, the web UI renders it as live controls, and a stale full-document save gets 409 conflict" width="780">
</p>

Every agent and session on a device shares one JSON document through the `read_state` and `update_state` tools. Each `update_state` call is one atomic path operation (create, update, delete or increment), so agents never overwrite each other's fields. The State tab renders the document as live controls, and a full-document save from a stale revision gets `409 conflict`. Use it to hand facts between agents, or to debug one issue across many sessions.

### Durable jobs: human near the loop

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/11_durable_jobs_wait.svg" alt="The release-check job checkpoints plan and gather, waits for a person at approve, then publishes, verifies and finishes" width="780">
</p>

A durable job is a repeatable workflow with named phases, and every phase is a checkpoint, so a restart resumes the current phase. Run one from the Tasks tab, or let the agent call `run_durable_job` and follow it with `check_durable_job`. Three ship as examples: `workspace-snapshot`, `change-watch` and `release-check`, where a subagent gathers the evidence and the job waits for a person before it publishes. You are not stuck in the loop and not out of it. **You are near the loop**, and you step in when a job asks for you.

### Change the tools mid-run

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/12_tools_change_mid_run.svg" alt="With Read only on, the 8 tools that write leave the agent's tool set and its next request sees the 6 that only read" width="780">
</p>

Every model call and every tool call is its own durable task, so the agent's tool set can change between requests. The Tools tab lists each tool with its signature and replay policy. Flip **Read only** and the 8 tools that write (`bash`, `write`, `edit`, `update_state` and the rest) leave the agent's next request, leaving the 6 that only read. Model and thinking level change the same way, and so do instructions through the API.

### Extensions

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/13_hook_blocks_tool.svg" alt="A bash rm -rf call reaches the jev-damage-control beforeTool hook, which blocks it as irreversible and returns a blocked tool result to the agent" width="780">
</p>

pi-durable extensions bring your own tools, hooks, prompt sections and checkpointed tasks. The Extend tab turns two custom extensions on or off per agent. `system-prompts` is a checklist of built-in prompts, led by [`smart_ass_opus_fix.md`](apps/anth-backend/prompts/smart_ass_opus_fix.md). `jev-damage-control` (off by default) sends every `bash` command to the Jev API before it runs and blocks destructive or irreversible ones in about 300 ms. Its verdict is a durable memo, so a restart never asks twice. If Jev is unreachable, the command runs.

### Fork at any entry

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/14_fork_at_any_entry.svg" alt="Main's thread forks at entry 8 into an experiment agent; both keep their own history from there" width="780">
</p>

Fork any agent at any entry, from the transcript or with `/fork`. The fork copies the conversation up to that entry and both agents keep going, so you can try another direction without losing the context you built. Forks nest under their parent in the tree.

---

## Any client: web, terminal, curl

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/15_web_client.png" alt="The web client: the network tree with five devices, the inspector's Session tab with the context bar, and an agent's transcript on a cloud VM" width="800">
</p>

The web client has three columns: the **network tree** (device → session → agent), the **inspector** and the **agent**. The inspector tabs are Session (model, thinking, context bar, usage), State, Tasks, Tools and Extend. The composer sends a follow-up, a steer (it joins after the current tool round) or a reject-if-busy, and `/` opens the slash commands. The paperclip (or a paste, or a drop) attaches up to 4 images, such as a logo or an icon: they are saved in the project folder under `.anth/uploads/` for the whole team, git-ignored, and shown to the agent when its model can see images. The browser never sees a token. It holds one SSE connection to the hub, and the hub opens the authenticated upstreams.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/16_terminal_client.svg" alt="anth-tui attached to vm-1:release-notes: the device, workspace and agent header, write and bash tool rows with results, and the model, context and cost footer" width="780">
</p>

`anth-tui` is pi's look and keys over the network API. Enter sends or steers, Alt+Enter queues a follow-up, Esc interrupts, and Ctrl+C on an empty prompt exits with the command to reattach. **The agent keeps running.**

```bash
just tui attach <device>                     # pick or create a session on a device
just tui attach <device>:<session>:<agent>   # straight to an agent, by name or id
just tui new <device> <name>                 # create a session in the device's first start dir and attach
```

Scripts and other agents can skip both clients. One request to an existing session sends the work and returns the answer:

```bash
curl -s "$URL/v1/sessions/oneshot/agents/main/messages" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"content":"How many files are in this directory? Use bash.","requestId":"oneshot-1","waitMs":120000}'
# {"submissionId":10,"status":"done","answer":{"entryId":17,"text":"The directory is empty. ..."}}
```

The [backend README](apps/anth-backend/README.md#demo-runbook-hop-into-an-already-running-agent) has the full runbook: start work in the TUI, steer it from the web, close both clients, restart the device mid-tool, and fork the resumed run.

---

## Configure your network

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/17_devices_are_data.svg" alt="anth-network.yaml lists local, mac-mini, linux-box and vm-1 by kind; just net up runs each kind's steps until every device is online" width="780">
</p>

Devices are data. `anth-network.yaml` declares each one by kind, and no code or recipe names a machine. It is gitignored; create it from [`anth-network.example.yaml`](anth-network.example.yaml), which declares only `local` and has commented `ssh` and `exe-dev` examples. Tokens never live in the YAML: each device generates its own, and `just net register <id>` copies it into the hub registry.

| Kind | How it runs | `just net up <id>` does |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | `just backend run` on this machine, or a service if you set `service:` | env file and registry entry (plus the service when set) |
| `ssh` | a launchd LaunchAgent (macOS) or a systemd unit (Linux) | install Node 24 with nvm, rsync the code and `npm ci`, env, service, register, wait online |
| `exe-dev` | systemd on an [exe.dev](https://exe.dev) VM behind its HTTPS proxy | create the named VM if missing, the `ssh` steps, expose port 4780 over HTTPS before register |
| `url` | anything already running | register the URL and token only |

```bash
just net up <id>         # every step the device's kind supports, in order; idempotent
just net status          # probe every device
just net deploy <id>     # ssh and exe-dev: rsync code, npm ci and restart; data stays
just net logs <id>       # tail the service log
just net restart <id>    # restart the service
just net rotate <id>     # new token on the device, then re-register
just net destroy <id>    # exe-dev only; asks first; refuses VMs not in the YAML
```

Every line of a device's `~/.anth/backend.env` traces to the YAML: `ANTH_PORT`, `ANTH_HOST` and `ANTH_START_DIRS` from `port`, `host` and `start_dirs`, secrets named in `env_keys` (values read from your `.env`), plain settings from `env`, the device id as `ANTH_DEVICE_NAME`, and a `ANTH_TOKEN` generated on the first `up`. New sessions start in `start_dirs` (default `~/anth-work`, created if missing), and any existing folder on the device works as a session's working directory. The hub classifies each device as `online`, `checking`, `offline`, `unauthorized`, `mismatch` (the URL now answers with a different device identity) or `incompatible`. An offline device keeps its last tree, dimmed, with the exact terminal fix for its kind.

## Why go durable

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/18_should_every_agent_be_durable.svg" alt="Short supervised single-terminal work fits plain Pi; surviving restarts, waiting hours for a human, many clients and starting before you sit down need Durable Pi" width="780">
</p>

Not every agent needs this. A short, supervised session in one terminal is fine with plain pi. Go durable when the work has to outlive the window you started it in:

| Reason | What it unlocks |
|---|---|
| **Proactive agents** | Agents that start from an event (a log row, a webhook, a schedule) and have the work ready when you arrive |
| **Multi-client agents** | One agent reached from the browser, the terminal, a script or your own product's UI |
| **Multiplayer agents** | Several engineers watch and steer the same agent, like an incident agent during an outage |
| **Long-running agents** | Close the laptop, kill the process or restart the machine, and the run resumes from its last checkpoint |
| **Human near the loop** | Approvals and questions are durable tasks, so an agent can wait hours for a decision |

Start in two places. **Product agents:** a support chatbot on your site should be durable by default, so a customer returns to the same session and you can watch it from any client. **Proactive agents:** put a cheap classifier in front of an event stream and let a durable agent do the first hour of work before anyone opens a laptop. One KPI tells you how far along you are: **how many agents are doing useful work for you right now, without you?**

---

## How it's built

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/19_sqlite_on_every_device.svg" alt="On every device anth-backend keeps catalog.sqlite, app-state.sqlite and one agent.sqlite per session; the hub keeps only network.sqlite with device URLs and tokens" width="780">
</p>

Each device owns its agents and their data in SQLite. The hub only stores how to reach them, so it can go away at any time.

just                       # command groups: net, backend, hub, tui, test, proactive
just install               # npm install for the four network apps
just check                 # type checks and unit tests, every app (free, no network)
just backend run           # this machine's device server on :4780
just hub start             # web UI on :4781
just tui attach <target>   # <device>[:<session>[:<agent>]]

```

### What has been checked

| Check | Result |

| `just check`: SDK (14), backend (10), hub (1) and TUI (8) unit tests with strict types, the web build and lint, on the faux model | **pass** |
| `just test ui`: 28 web checks against two faux devices, including offline recovery, bad tokens, read only, extensions, durable jobs, the context bar, slash commands, keyboard and mobile | **28 of 28** |
| `just test device` on a cloud VM with a real model: the web UI, steer, dedupe, subagents, jobs, compaction, reset, and quitting the browser mid-tool | **18 of 18** |
| `just test e2e` on an ssh Mac: TUI and web on one run, steer from the web, both clients closed, device restarted mid-tool, fork, TUI reattach | **pass**: 9 tool results, 1 interrupted by the restart, each prompt admitted once |
| `just test smoke faux`: TUI streaming, steer, Esc, fork, exit and reattach by name | **pass** |
| Proactive demo, end to end: incident opens at T+6 s, the deploy waits at T+27 to 30 s, the approved revision passes 3 guest checkouts with 0 errors | **pass** |
| Every device: `/healthz` 200 and `/v1/*` without a token 401 (`just net probe <id>`) | **pass** |

- **Durable means checkpointed, not exactly-once.** A `requestId` is admitted once, but an external effect (a payment, a page, a deploy) may have happened right before a crash. Replay-safe tools rerun and unsafe ones return an interrupted result. Effects still need their own idempotency.
- **A token is a shell.** Anyone holding a device's token can run commands as that device's user. `start_dirs` only set where sessions begin. They are not a sandbox.
- **Agents never see the backend's environment.** Upstream pi-durable passes the whole process environment to every agent command, so an agent's `echo $ANTH_TOKEN` printed the device token. Anth-Agent's `AgentExecutionEnv` gives agent commands only `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `SHELL`, `TMPDIR`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `TERM` and `TZ`; deploy and GitHub tokens are read only by the ship job's own steps.
- **LAN `ssh` devices speak plain HTTP**, so tokens cross the LAN in cleartext. exe.dev devices use HTTPS, and their proxy is public, so the token is the only gate.
- **The hub holds every token.** It binds `127.0.0.1` and checks Host and Origin headers. Binding it to the LAN exposes every device it can reach.
- **`anth-backend` binds `127.0.0.1` unless told otherwise.** For `ssh` and `exe-dev` devices, `just net up` writes `ANTH_HOST=0.0.0.0` (the default for the YAML's `host`) so clients can reach them, and the token guards everything under `/v1`.
- **`jev-damage-control` is a guard, not a sandbox.** It sends each command to a third-party API, and when Jev is unreachable the command runs.
- **The proactive demo has no login** and its agents run `bash`. It binds `127.0.0.1` unless you pass `--host 0.0.0.0`.
- **macOS devices run as a LaunchAgent** in the logged-in session, so unattended reboots need auto-login.
- **pi-durable is experimental.** This repo pins 1.0.3.
